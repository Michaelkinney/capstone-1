<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>
* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* 
* The problem is to create a front end store with a seperate page cart with multiple functionalities, including a 
  add to cart, increase decrease, remove from cart as well as displaying the total both in number of items and dollar amount.
* 
* 
* 
* 
*

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*  Deciding between movies, dog toys, or car parts
*  I believe the home page hould have a banner that represents my store.
   It will only have 2 sections, a navbar and a body which will display all of my items.
   
*  The cart page should have a increase and decrease, it should display the total amount of money at the bottom. And it should
also have the ability to completely remove it from the cart.
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*  I executed this plan with react-redux
   The front home page was easy to understand and execute. Adding functionality to the second page and connecting state with redux
   was very confusing.

    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*   Reflection, i was happy with some of the functionalities i was able to implement. Especially the hover over the image for the purchase function,
	as well as the total # of items displayed in the cart.
	Sadly time ran out in hopes of implementing a search bar function.
